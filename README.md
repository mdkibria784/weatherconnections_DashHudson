3.	Pull from this list (CSV Fille attached) of cities
4.	Get the Average Daily Temperature for each city for the next five days from the Openweather API
5.	Calculate the Average Daily Temperature for each location for the next five days from the Open Weather API
6.	Combine this data and put it into a CSV/JSON
○	*normally the next step would be to schedule this to push it back to our warehouse or another application through the API on a regular basis
○	Expect output of CSV Columns (date, city, avg. temp, country, language, climate, population from CSV, population from API, population difference (you will have to calculate this))
Lastly calculate the Average temperature for the next 5 days from the top 10 cities with the highest elevation.
